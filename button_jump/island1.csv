NANUKULEVU ISLAND
Asking price: USD 3,250,000 plus vat if applicable

Sometimes it's possible to pursue your dream with a huge head start. Fiji's Nanukulevu Island is just such an opportunity—12.5 acres of tropical beauty on leasehold land, covered with coconut palms and surrounded by white-sand beaches and turquoise waters. It's the holiday paradise project of the current owners, who for health reasons are not able to see their dream through, and now hope that their hard work will pay off and someone else can live out the dream.
